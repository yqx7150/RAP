Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is essential in clinical settings to minimize radiation exposure; however, reducing the dose often leads to a significant decline in image quality. Additionally, conventional deep learning approaches typically require large datasets, raising con-cerns about privacy, costs, and time constraints. To ad-dress these challenges, a few-shot low-dose CT reconstruc-tion method is proposed, utilizing low-Rank Angular Pri-or (RAP) multi-diffusion model. In the prior learning phase, projection data is transformed into multiple con-secutive views organized by angular segmentation, allow-ing for the extraction of rich prior information through low-rank processing. This structured approach enhances the learning capacity of the multi-diffusion model. Dur-ing the iterative reconstruction phase, a stochastic differ-ential equation solver is employed alongside data con-sistency constraints to iteratively refine the acquired pro-jection data. Furthermore, penalized weighted least-squares and total variation techniques are integrated to improve image quality. Results demonstrate that the re-constructed images closely resemble those obtained from normal-dose CT, validating the RAP model as an effec-tive and practical solution for artifact and noise reduc-tion while preserving image fidelity in low-dose situation.
